An introduction to OS development

5th April 2017:

This simple UNIX-clone OS is an approach of OS development based on James Molloy's
tutorial 'aims to take you through programming a simple UNIX-clone OS' that
I have choose to take in order to understand the basics concepts of POSIX and UNIX.

If you are reading this, you should take a look to this very good web site :

http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/

For now, the project is just a school work and a simple verbatim of James Molloy's
work. But, if you are interested in developing the subject, don't hesitate to
contact me.

This readme could possibly change during the next weeks.
